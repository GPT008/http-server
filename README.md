## Introduction

The HTTP server project is a straightforward implementation of an HTTP server that can handle basic requests. It helps developers grasp how web servers operate, including handling client requests, serving files, and managing connections.

## Features

- **Simple Architecture**: Understand the core components of an HTTP server.
- **Request Handling**: Process GET and POST requests.
- **Static File Serving**: Serve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- **Logging**: Basic logging of requests for debugging.
- **Multi-threading**: Handle multiple connections simultaneously.

## Getting Started

To get started with the HTTP server, you will need to have a C compiler installed on your machine. This project is compatible with various operating systems, including Linux and macOS.

### Prerequisites

- C Compiler (GCC recommended)
- Make (optional but recommended for building)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GPT008/http-server.git
   cd http-server
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. Run the server:

   ```bash
   ./http-server
   ```

## Usage

After running the server, you can access it through your web browser. Open `http://localhost:8080` to see the server in action. You can place your HTML files in the designated directory to serve them.

### Example Request

You can test the server using `curl`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080
```

This command should return the content of the index.html file or whatever file is set as the default.

## Code Structure

The project consists of several key files and directories:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the HTTP server.
- `include/`: Contains header files.
- `Makefile`: Used for building the project.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

### Main Components

- **main.c**: The entry point of the server.
- **server.c**: Handles server initialization and client connections.
- **request.c**: Processes incoming HTTP requests.
- **response.c**: Constructs HTTP responses to send back to clients.
